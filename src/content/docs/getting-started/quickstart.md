description: This guide will walk you through creating your first Eko workflow in a browser extension environment.
---

Let's create an Eko workflow together in a browser extension to automate the task that `Search Sam Altman's information and summarize it into markdown format for export`. 

> With this plugin, you no longer need to manually open multiple web pages; instead, you can run everything with a single click.

## Load extension

- Download latest stable version of [FellouAI/eko-browser-extension-template](https://github.com/FellouAI/eko-browser-extension-template/releases). Unzip the ZIP file to a suitable location, and you should see a `dist` folder.
- Open the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Turn on `Developer mode` (toggle switch in the top right corner).
- Click `Load unpacked` button (the blue text in the top-left corner) and select the `dist` folder in the first step.
- For **Chinese** users: If it's inconvenient to obtain an API key from the OpenAI or Claude platform, consider using mirror sites or services (such as [ZetaTechs API](https://api.zetatechs.com/)), and then replace the *Base URL* and *API key* with the corresponding values.

If you want to view more logs, you can right-click on the Eko icon and select "Inspect popup", which will open the Chrome DevTools window. Once opened, please ensure that this window is not in focus to avoid any issues with some tools not functioning properly.
