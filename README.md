# Eko docs

## What is Eko?
Eko (pronounced like â€˜echoâ€™) is a production-ready JavaScript framework that enables developers to create reliable agents, from simple commands to complex workflows. It provides a unified interface for running agents in both computer and browser environments, with the following key features:

- **Hybrid design language**: Developers can write agents by both natural language and programming languages, enabling production-grade agent design.
- **Unified digital World interaction**: Eko offers a unified syntax that is applicable across various digital environments, including computers and browsers, for seamless agent development.
- **Transparent and intervenable agents**: During agent execution, users can inspect its state in real-time and modify its behavior, ensuring greater control and security.

The framework is particularly focused on bridging the gap between natural language task descriptions and concrete system actions through a structured approach.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Eko docs project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
